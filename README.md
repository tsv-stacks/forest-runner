### _[My First Game](https://tsv-stacks.github.io/my-first-game/)_

</center>

I found a short tutorial that showed me how to create a basic version of the "dinosaur" Google Chrome game. The game was an endless runner, with oncoming blocks that I had to jump over. It was a simple game, but it was a proof of concept that games could be built with JavaScript.

> The game can be started by clicking the `Start` button. Once the game starts, the character can be made to jump by pressing the `Space` key on your keyboard. The game ends if the character collides with the block.

### _[My Second Game](https://arcade-game-runner.netlify.app/)_

</center>

With this new confidence and knowledge, I began working on a more advanced and visually appealing game. I found a game development course online that helped me create this new game, which was built with vanilla JavaScript, CSS, HTML5, and the Canvas API.

I wanted to make this game feel unique and rather than copy someones code or code along I decided to use assets from itch.io (a platform for game developers to share and sell their artwork and game assets). Using these assets presented me with new challenges, as I had to understand the logic behind the code in order to make necessary amendments and add my own features, such as scores, game over, and restart.

Unfortunately, due to time constraints, I was not able to fully flesh out the game as much as I would have liked. There were multiple features and functionalities missing that would have made it a complete game.

> Jump over the incoming slime enemies by using the arrow keys on your keyboard to control the player. You have 3 lives and you lose a life every time you collide with an enemy. The game ends if the player loses all three lives. To restart the game after the game over, the player can press the Enter key.

### _[Into the Forest](https://into-the-forest.netlify.app/)_

</center>

I wanted to build on the success of my previous two games and take the lessons I learned from building a local cooperative [two-player fighting game](https://github.com/tsv-stacks/fighting-game) to create a more 'complete' game, but was unable to do so due to time constraints.

Into the Forest was built as an improved version that enhances and refines the features and gameplay mechanics from the second game: 
- The player now has many more animations and movements, and there are more attacks, each with their own hitboxes and sound effects.
- Enemies now have more animations and do not just sit in an idle animation; they will attack the player or attempt to when the player is within a certain range.
- I have added an in-game guide, mute, pause, and reset buttons, all with UI sounds to provide audio feedback to players.
- To help with hitboxes and collisions, I created a debug mode that can be triggered with the semicolon `;` button.
- Spawning enemies is no longer random. At certain scores, the probability of enemies spawning is increased.
- Made changes to existing sprites to adjust animations using image editors

These changes, along with many more tweaks and adjustments, I hope make this game more enjoyable and fun to play than the last.
